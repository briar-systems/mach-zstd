# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release only. Older releases are not patched.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/briar-systems/mach-zstd/security/advisories/new)
rather than opening a public issue.

mach-zstd reads untrusted input by design: Zstandard frames from any producer. A malformed input that makes zstd crash, hang, or read or write out of bounds is a vulnerability and is welcome as a report.

Expect an acknowledgement within a few days. If the report is confirmed we will
prepare a fix and coordinate disclosure with you. If it is declined we will
explain why.
